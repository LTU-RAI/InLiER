# 🖥️ Command Line

← back to the [README](../README.md)

Installing the package puts an `inlier` command on your PATH:

```bash
inlier --help
```

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `inlier doctor` | check the backend, dependencies, dataset layout, and ground-truth consistency |
| `inlier config show` \| `dump` | print the effective configuration — after merging defaults, `--config`, and `--set` |
| `inlier encode` | run just the encoder on a scan or a directory, writing keypoints + tokens, and optionally plotting them |
| `inlier gt build` \| `validate` | build or sanity-check the overlap ground truth |
| `inlier eval cross-session` | run the evaluation protocol |
| `inlier play` | replay a finished run as an animation |
| `inlier bench cpp-vs-py` | time the C++ core against the numpy reference |

Common flags work on either side of the command name:

- `-c/--config FILE` — a YAML file, merged onto the packaged defaults
- `--set KEY=VALUE` — override one key, e.g. `--set stage1.topk=50` (repeatable)
- `--backend {auto,cpp,python}` — force a backend (see [C++ Core](cpp-core.md))
- `-q/--quiet` — suppress the banner and per-stage progress

The first two are layered onto the packaged defaults and validated — see
[Configuration](configuration.md) for the merge order and the parameter table.

## Checking a Dataset

`inlier doctor` checks `--dataset` against the layout `--dataset-type` names —
the same flag `inlier eval` takes, defaulting to `helipr`. The two layouts have
nothing in common, so point it at the right one:

```bash
inlier doctor --dataset /data/HeLiPR                          # <seq>/Undistorted/<sensor>/
inlier doctor --dataset /data/campus --dataset-type generic   # scans/ + poses_kitti.txt
```

A dataset checked against the wrong layout is reported as a layout mismatch
rather than as empty.

## Inspecting a descriptor

`inlier encode --viz` draws one page per scan: the cloud and its keypoints in
the ground-aligned frame the encoder bins in, then the three matrices the
matcher actually scores on — the token histogram `H`, the MINT row `R` that
stage 1 compares, and the BEAM elevation codes `A` that stage 2 shifts and
scores — plus the shape-class and height-slice distributions.

```bash
inlier encode scan.bin --viz                       # open a window
inlier encode scan.bin --viz-save scan.png         # write it instead
inlier encode scans/ -o tokens/ --viz-save figs/   # one figure per scan
```

`--viz-save` forces a headless backend, so it works over ssh and in CI. It is
required when the input is a directory, since `--viz` alone would open a window
per scan. `-o/--output` is optional when you only want the figure.

This is the quickest way to tell whether a token grid suits a new sensor: if
the top height slices are empty, `z_max` is too high for the platform; if the
BEAM panel is nearly all one colour, `N_r`/`N_a` are too coarse to separate
structure. The parameters themselves are documented in
[Configuration](configuration.md).

## Encoding submaps

A bare scan path encodes one scan. The evaluation encodes accumulated
**submaps** whenever `--n-db`/`--n-q` are above 1, so what you inspect should
be built the same way — `--dataset` does that, merging each window of scans
into its keyframe's frame using the poses:

```bash
inlier encode --dataset /data/campus --n-scans 10 --index 0 --viz
inlier encode --dataset /data/campus --n-scans 10 --stride 5 --range 0:20 -o submaps/
```

Only the scans the selected submaps need are read, so inspecting one submap out
of several hundred is cheap. `--index` accepts negatives (`-1` is the last
submap) and resolves them before they reach filenames or provenance.

`--n-scans` and `--stride` **must match what the overlap ground truth was built
with** — see [Overlap Ground Truth](custom-data.md#overlap-ground-truth). The
window rule is shared with the overlap builder
([`inlier/eval/submaps.py`](../inlier/eval/submaps.py)) so the two cannot
drift, and the values are written into the `.npz` alongside the token radices.

> HeLiPR has no submap accumulation: it is evaluated scan by scan
> (`HeLiPRSource` carries no `n_scans`/`stride`, and the published results are
> one submap per scan). Point `inlier encode` straight at a `.bin`.

## Migrating from 0.2.x

The scripts under `evaluation/` are now thin shims that print the equivalent
`inlier` command and forward. They are removed in 0.4.0. Every flag is now
`--kebab-case`; the `--snake_case` spellings the 0.2.x README documented are
still accepted everywhere.
